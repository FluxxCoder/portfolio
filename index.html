      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        I'm Karl Shariff D. Milanes, 23 years old. I graduated from the Adventist University of the Philippines with a Bachelor of Science degree in Nutrition and Dietetics, with my innate love and interest in technology, I decided to shift from nutrition and dietetics to full-stack web development. Whenever I visit various websites, I notice how the layout, UI, UX, and animations look and work. I dream of being able to do web apps and I am very eager to learn more and pursue a career in this field

        <h3>DietRx, Diet Therapy&Meal Planning</h3>
        <p>As Nutritionists, we counsel clients on nutrition issues and healthy eating habits. Dietitians and nutritionists are experts in the use of food and nutrition to promote health and manage disease. We plan and conduct food service or nutritional programs to help people lead healthy lives. We have an advanced knowledge of food and nutrition science, physiology, and biochemistry which we use to develop diets tailored to each person's individual needs and health goals.

        <h3>Basic Programming</h3>
        <p>As of now, I'm developing my skill as a programmer and a web developer. Soon enough, I dream to become an expert in this field and help people in their everyday lives. Programming is a skill that can be used for many different purposes. The types of software are infinite, so the opportunities are endless as well. Plus, programming allows you to be creative and create something that you can be proud of. Also, you can be your own boss and decide when, where, and how you work. That being said, there are still many challenges ahead for me and I will do my best to overcome them and learn as much as I can in the process.

        <h3>Musically Inclined</h3>
        <p> As a kid, I really develop an interest in music and playing instruments. I have a 3-year of experience as a lead guitarist in a local band. I really develop my intercommunication skills during my time this said experience. As of now, I laid low on this path and focused on WebDev. I love coding and writing code. Currently, I am in the process of shifting my focus to a career in web development/design. But nonetheless, the experience I had as a lead guitarist has help me develop my soft skills and learned a lot of new things that will help me throughout my life and in my career.

          <q>
            If you're looking for a way to optimize your time and improve your nutrition, consider 
          obtaining a Best in Meal Planning certificate. Obtaining this certificate helped me meal
           plan for the week, create balanced and healthy vegan meals, and make sure you're getting all
            of the nutrients you need to stay healthy! This certificate also taught how to shop for healthy foods 
            on a budget, plan meals for an entire month, and make healthy recipes that the whole family will love!
